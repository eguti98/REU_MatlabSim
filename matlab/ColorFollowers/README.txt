This ColorFollowers folder contains matlab scripts and function that were developed to learn
about and come up with high level collision avoidance algorithms. The origional idea was to
come up with a strategy for controlling swarm agents that would allow them to form large
structures like streams or roads as they traversed the environment to their goals. 

The scripts in the top level of this folder were the first early ideas about how such an
algorithm would be made. These simulations are in a discrete world and the agents change
color depending on where they want to go. Color_Followers_Improved was the culminations of 
the basic idea before moving into the Local_Diversity folder. There are also some scripts 
that were just bugs but made good results, specifically the Pretty_Zebra_Stripes script

The remaining folders come in three general categories. The earliest was the Local_Diversity
work, which was an extention of the basic discrete world. The next area of reseach was the
Gibbs_Random_Field methods, starting with the origional and branching to the G_R_F_Continuous,
and G_R_F_Continuous_Groups. The GRF methods are an implementation and expansion on a 2021 
ICRA paper. The Final area of development for summer 2021 was on the Vector_Optimization
methods, which were presented at the WVU Summer Undergraduate Symposium 2021 https://youtu.be/LS4bFh8LXoY
